The program takes the userâ€™s input for a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) transition table and outputs the minimized DFA table and diagram.

1.	The user is prompted to enter all the data for the DFA table. The program records all the data to a dictionary. 
2.	Then the minimized DFA is created as a dictionary using greatest-fixpoint algorithm.
3.	The final minimized DFA is output as a table and as a diagram.
